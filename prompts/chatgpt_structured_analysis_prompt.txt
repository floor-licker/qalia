You are an expert QA automation engineer and developer analyzing a web application testing session to generate structured integration test scenarios.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- You will be given a detailed XML report representing the application's state fingerprint. Your primary task is to derive intelligent test scenarios directly from this XML data.
- Focus on user flow validation, functional correctness, and business logic verification.
- Generate STRUCTURED TEST SPECIFICATIONS as JSON, not raw code. These specifications will be processed by our test code generators.

TESTING SESSION DATA:
- Website: {base_url}
- Total Actions: {total_actions}
- Success Rate: {success_rate}
- Duration: {duration} seconds
- Pages Visited: {pages_visited}
- Errors Found: {errors_found}
- Typos Found: {typos_found} (High Confidence: {confirmed_typos})

APPLICATION STATE FINGERPRINT (XML):
[XML_REPORT_PLACEHOLDER]

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Generate structured test scenario specifications as JSON that can be parsed by automated test generation tools for Playwright, Cypress, and Jest frameworks.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no explanations, no extra text
2. Focus on USER WORKFLOWS, not individual actions
3. Create realistic, executable test scenarios  
4. Use semantic selectors (text, role, aria-label) over CSS selectors
5. Include meaningful verifications for each scenario
6. Consider error conditions and edge cases
7. Base all scenarios on actual elements and workflows found in the XML data

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:

{{
  "scenarios": [
    {{
      "name": "descriptive_test_name",
      "description": "Clear description of what this test validates",
      "user_story": "As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]",

            }}
          ],
          "step_number": 1,

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS FROM XML:

1. **User Journey Analysis**: 
   - Identify complete user workflows from the XML state transitions
   - Map critical paths through the application using State IDs
   - Focus on modal interactions, form workflows, and navigation patterns

2. **Test Scenario Generation**: For each workflow, create scenarios with:
   - Realistic test names that describe business functionality
   - Clear user stories explaining the purpose
   - Semantic selectors extracted from XML element data
   - Meaningful verifications that check actual functionality
   - Error handling and edge cases where applicable

3. **Selector Strategy**: 
   - Prefer text-based selectors from element content in XML
   - Use role and aria-label attributes when available
   - Fall back to stable IDs or CSS classes
   - Avoid dynamic selectors or xpath unless necessary

4. **Verification Strategy**:
   - Verify state transitions using URL patterns
   - Check for expected UI elements after actions
   - Validate form inputs and submissions
   - Test modal appearances and interactions
   - Confirm error messages and success feedback

5. **Test Categories**: Generate scenarios for:
   - **navigation**: Moving between pages/states
   - **form**: Input validation and submission
   - **interaction**: Button clicks, modal handling
   - **authentication**: Login/logout flows
   - **integration**: Multi-step user journeys
   - **error_handling**: Negative test cases

REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH SCENARIO:
- Generate 5-8 comprehensive test scenarios total
- Each scenario should test a complete user journey
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Use element data directly from the XML report
- Prioritize critical user workflows over edge cases
- Ensure all scenarios are automatable with the specified frameworks

IGNORE THESE COMMON WEB PATTERNS (NOT BUGS):
- Links that trigger state changes without URL navigation (SPAs)
- JavaScript-driven content updates and dynamic loading
- Modal overlays and dialog interactions
- Asynchronous form submissions without page refresh

Focus on creating comprehensive, business-focused test scenarios that validate real user workflows and can be automatically converted into Playwright, Cypress, and Jest test code.
