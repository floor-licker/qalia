# üó∫Ô∏è Qalia Embedded UI Recorder - Development Roadmap

## üéØ Vision

Extend Qalia's automated testing capabilities with an interactive UI that allows users to manually record, create, and manage test cases through an embedded browser interface. This complements our existing automated webhook approach by giving users direct control over test creation.

## üìã Current State

- ‚úÖ **Automated Webhook System**: AI-powered exploration and test generation on PR events
- ‚úÖ **Core Infrastructure**: Browser management, action execution, test generation pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Framework Support**: Playwright, Cypress, Jest test export
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Integration**: Automated analysis and reporting

## üöÄ Target Architecture

### Dual-Mode Operation
1. **Automated Mode** (Existing): Webhook ‚Üí AI Exploration ‚Üí Test Generation
2. **Manual Mode** (New): Web UI ‚Üí User Recording ‚Üí Test Management

### Key Components
- **Embedded Browser Interface**: Target application rendered within Qalia UI
- **Real-time Action Recorder**: Capture and display user interactions
- **Test Management Dashboard**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tests
- **Session Management**: Save and replay recorded interactions
- **Hybrid Workflows**: Combine AI-generated and manually recorded tests
